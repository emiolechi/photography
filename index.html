            <h2>Hello stranger friend.</h2>
            <p>I will to tell you a story. My name is {{name}}, I was born in 1986 halfway between Jaipur and Pushkar in the trunk of a Mercedes station wagon. My parents, who were still hard on the hippie trail at the time, met not too long before in Portugal. I was probably conceived in Essaouira, but maybe also in Imlil, my parents don't agree on that. When I was six, I was forgotten at my grandparents in Bologna. Becaused I got bored then ran off to Amsterdam when I was seventeen. There I got lost and spent some time with the squatters at Bajesdorp. Best prison view included. I followed in my mother's footsteps on the Camden streets and stumbled through the dark tunnels of the Ligne de petite ceinture. I lived on the beach in Cabo de Gata and enjoyed my soy capucino in the backyards of Glasgow. Today I live withdrawn and deeply relaxing in the woods of Sm√•land and enjoy life like never before. Some time ago I stole a camera in Groningen and started taking photos. Spiritualized walk in the footsteps of my creators to find my nonexistent body.</p>
            <h2>The beast I found.</h2>
            <p>On my travels I breathe the beauty of the universe and eat the people's money. I immerse myself in the absence of culture. An animal spirit gave me a body. I am a proud animal on the hunt. The colors of the world behave like those of the stones that you take out of cold clear water. Disappearing before your eyes. Dried out gray. I hunt them. My only striving, one compulsion. There is only beauty. I am aware of the ugliness, but I am blind to it and see nothing at all. My eyes deserve the miracles. I do not see you. I see almost nothing. I see the past. It's getting darker. There is only beauty. I will not tolerate anything else. I will force it. And then I don't see my hatred anymore.</p>
            <h2>It's free, you'll love it.</h2>
            <p>Since I have several years of experience in the backyard internet scam business, I would like to share my knowledge and give you this well-behaved image viewer for free. If you're like me, you might benefit from it. I want everybody to be able to admire great photography without having to get a fucked up Insta account. I don't feel like reading shitty comments - a static page fits perfectly. Since everyone wants money from me, I don't feel like paying for the hosting and let Microsoft take care of it. Visit my <a href="https://github.com/emiolechi/photography">GitHub</a> for more information.</p>
            <h2>There's not only one thruth.</h2>
            <p>The truth is boring, if not it's a lie. So we tell fairy tales. Each story can only be told once. And only at the right time. There are bonus points for every new thought that can be derived from a good story. Sincerely, the authors remain.</p>
